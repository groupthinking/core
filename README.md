üß± PHASE 1: CORE SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP ‚Äî MVP STACK
1. Core Components
Module	Tool/Tech	Purpose
Smart Contracts	Solidity + Hardhat	Agent registry, payments, royalties, staking
Agent Metadata Registry	IPFS + NFT (ERC-721 / ERC-6551)	Stores agent manifests, versioned logic
Execution Layer	Docker + gRPC API or WASM (via WASI)	Agent containers run off-chain, securely
Frontend UI	Next.js + Wagmi + RainbowKit	Connect wallet, browse, deploy, hire agents
Payments Layer	Superfluid or StreamPay	Continuous payments per compute/time used
Data Layer	Filecoin or Arweave	Persistent agent files, logs, models

‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 2: PROTOCOL LAYER DESIGN
2. Smart Contract Layout
solidity
Copy
Edit
- AgentFactory.sol        // Deploys new agent contracts
- AgentNFT.sol            // Each agent = NFT with metadata pointer
- StakingManager.sol      // Developers & consumers stake for trust
- ExecutionEscrow.sol     // Pay-per-use, refunds if failure
- ReputationOracle.sol    // Tracks uptime, success rate, reviews
3. Agent Manifest Schema (stored on IPFS)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "AutoTweetGPT",
  "version": "v1.0.3",
  "description": "Automates tweets using OpenAI and trending hashtags",
  "inputs": {
    "text": "string",
    "schedule": "cron"
  },
  "outputs": {
    "status": "success/failure",
    "response": "tweet_id"
  },
  "dependencies": ["OpenAI", "TwitterAPI"],
  "compute_type": "offchain",
  "verifiable": true
}
üîí PHASE 3: EXECUTION & TRUST LAYER
4. Execution Infrastructure
Method	Stack	Comment
TEE-based	Intel SGX + Fortanix + Gramine	Proven, but requires trust in enclave
ZKML (Optional)	RiscZero, zkML, Giza	For proving outputs of light models
Decentralized Compute	Akash / Bacalhau / Golem	Rent cheap, verifiable execution power

5. Sandboxing
All agent code must run in a sandboxed container

Inputs/outputs hashed, logged, and optionally verified with zk proof or signed enclave attestation

üí∞ PHASE 4: INCENTIVES & MONETIZATION
6. Token Design
AGNT: Utility token for usage, staking, curation

AGNT-REP: Non-transferable rep token; earned from reviews, uptime, peer endorsements

7. Payment Mechanisms
Feature	Tool
Metered Usage	Chainlink Functions or Offchain Oracle
Recurring	Superfluid streams (per second billing)
Upfront w/ Refund	ExecutionEscrow.sol + validator callback

üß© PHASE 5: COMPOSABILITY ENGINE
8. Composable Agent Graphs
Each agent exposes a schema.json (input/output)

Use a visual or JSON-defined pipeline to chain agents

Deploy composite agents as a new NFT with underlying references

üèõÔ∏è PHASE 6: GOVERNANCE DAO
9. Bootstrapping DAO
Use DAOHaus or Tally + OpenZeppelin Governor

Roles:

Curators (whitelist agents)

Dispute Resolvers (slashing or refund)

Upgraders (protocol changes)

10. Moderation & Curation
Token-curated registry: users stake to endorse good agents

Slashing for fraud/malicious agents

Bug bounty pool for exploit discoverers

üß™ PHASE 7: PILOT & LAUNCH
11. Launch Strategy
Action	Detail
MVP Deployment	5‚Äì10 agents from internal team
Pilot Partner	Onboard 3 external devs to test marketplace
First Paid Use	Launch public bounty: ‚ÄúDeploy the best summarization agent under $10‚Äù
Open Sourcing	Agent SDK + CLI tool to wrap any Python script as an agent

üß† PHASE 8: OPTIONAL ADVANCED ADD-ONS
Add-on	Description
zkExecution Tracer	Prove agent executed logic without revealing inputs
Plugin Layer	Let external apps (e.g. Zapier, Discord, Shopify) call agents
Agent-2-Agent Trading	Agents call each other and pay for services autonomously
On-chain Reputation NFTs	Developer resume NFTs (agent portfolios)

üß≠ CHECKLIST FOR LAUNCH READINESS
